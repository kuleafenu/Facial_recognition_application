`Project Goal`:Identify faces in video stream with Deep Dearning.


# 💻 [Face Recognition Library](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/).
Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world’s simplest face recognition library.

Built using dlib’s **state-of-the-art** face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.


# 🔥 Facial Recognition Summary steps.

> `Encoder.py' file.
- Grab labels and images.
- Extracts faces from the whole image.
- Create image embedding.
>`Recognizer.py`
- Extract faces from video frames.
- Create face embedding.
- Compare the face embeddings with the embeddings created earlier using the `encoder.py` file.
- Selects and outputs the label of the best match.
